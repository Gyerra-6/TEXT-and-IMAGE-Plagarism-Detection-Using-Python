# Text and Image Plagiarism Detection Using Python

A Python-based toolkit for detecting both **textual and visual plagiarism**, suitable for academic, publishing, or content-moderation use cases.

---

## Key Features

- **Text Plagiarism Detection** – Uses NLP algorithms (e.g., cosine similarity, fingerprinting) to compare textual content.
- **Image Plagiarism Detection** – Applies image hashing and similarity metrics to identify copied or near-duplicate images.
- **Threshold-Based Alerts** – Customizable similarity thresholds for both text and image comparisons.
- **Detailed Reporting** – Provides clear similarity scores, highlighting suspicious matches.
- **Batch Processing** – Supports bulk detection in directories of documents and images.
- **Extensible & Modular** – Easily integrate new detection algorithms, formats, or reporting styles.

## What the Project Does

This toolkit allows users to:

1. Input or batch-upload text files and images.
2. Run plagiarism checks (text vs. text, image vs. image).
3. Receive similarity scores and structured output reports.
4. Customize detection thresholds and file-processing behavior.

## How to Run 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)  

## Setup & Execution

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Gyerra-6/TEXT-and-IMAGE-Plagarism-Detection-Using-Python.git
cd TEXT-and-IMAGE-Plagarism-Detection-Using-Python

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the detection script
python detect_plagiarism.py --mode text --input_dir texts/ --threshold 0.8
python detect_plagiarism.py --mode image --input_dir images/ --threshold 0.9
```

---

Check the script’s help (--help) for additional options and formats.

Roadmap & Potential Enhancements
- Add support for PDF and DOCX parsing in text detection.
- Use deep-learning image embeddings for more accurate image similarity.
- Create a GUI or web interface for easier end-to-end use.
- Integrate email or Slack alerts for high plagiarism scores.
- Expand batch processing to handle subdirectory traversal and multi-format documents.
